# Django Email Templates

Email Templates is an open source Django app developed by [Concentric Sky](http://concentricsky.com/) to allow creation and editing of email templates in Django's admin interface. The resulting templates can be referenced in code and will be rendered with standard Django template context.


## Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/concentricsky/django-emailtemplates.git

Include Email Templates in your settings.py.

    INSTALLED_APPS = [

        ...

        'emailtemplates',

        ...
    ]

Send an email by using the send_email_template utility.

    from emailtemplates.utils import send_email_template
    send_email_template('template_slug', 'toemail@example.com', {'context_variable': 'foo'})


## Optional Settings

By default, the FROM address on emails will be `noreply` at the domain returned by Site.objects.get_current(). You can override that default in your settings.py:

    EMAILTEMPLATES_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'noreply@yourdomain.com'

You can also implement DEBUG mode, where only email addresses that match your whitelist will receive emails.

    EMAILTEMPLATES_DEBUG = True
    EMAILTEMPLATES_DEBUG_WHITELIST = ['someone@yourdomain.com','anotherdomain.com',]
